In order to make this webpage more accessible, I did the following:

* Used semantic HTML elements
* Used semantic HTML elements that followed a logical structure
* Made sure all `<img>` elements had accessible `alt` attributes
* Made sure all headings (like `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and so on) fall in sequential order
* Entered a concise, descriptive text in `<title>`
* I re-ordered all CSS and commented it so that it paralleled the HTML

You can find the page at: <https://giocalix4.github.io/horiseon/>.

The result is:
